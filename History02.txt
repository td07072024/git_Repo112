Sambhal is identified as Shambhala, a village which is mentioned as the birthplace of Kalki, the tenth and last incarnation of Vishnu, in the Mahabharata and the Hindu Puranas such as the Skanda Purana, Bhavishya Purana and later Kalki Purana (the city is also home to a "Shri Kalki Vishnu Mandir").[8][9][10][11] This was borrowed into the Buddhist mythology of Tibetan Buddhism where it is described as a mythological kingdom and a pure land beyond the Himalayas where the future Maitreya will emerge from.[12] According to Ibn Battuta, Toghon Tem√ºr the last Yuan dynasty emperor of China had sent an embassy to the Sultan of Delhi Muhammad bin Tughluq, requesting permission to rebuild a Buddhist temple at Sambhal, which at the time attracted pilgrims from Tibet.[13]

Sambhal has been an urban center for hundreds of years and was a prominent town during the medieval period. Two legendary battles between Prithviraj Chauhan and Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud are claimed to have taken place here. At the time under local rulers, in the 13th and 14th-centuries it would go on to become a part of the Delhi Sultanate, first under Qutb ud-Din Aibak and later under Firuz Shah Tughlaq.
